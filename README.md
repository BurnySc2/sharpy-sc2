# sc2-sharpy
Python framework for rapid development of Starcraft 2 AI bots

Sharpy uses [python-sc2](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2) and it is the framework used by [Sharpened Edge](https://ai-arena.net/bots/40/).

## Work in progress, does not build
The framework has all the necessary components to run the dummy bots that are used for testing against Sharpened Edge.
