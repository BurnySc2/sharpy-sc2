# sc2-sharpy
Python framework for rapid development of Starcraft 2 AI bots

Sharpy uses [python-sc2](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2) and it is the framework used by [Sharpened Edge](https://ai-arena.net/bots/40/).

## Work in progress
The framework has all the necessary components to run the dummy bots that are used for testing against Sharpened Edge.
The folder structure is subject to change.

## Requirements
Python 3.7 (>=3.8 is not supported yet)

## Ladder Dummy Bots
To build dummy bot for ladder, run ladder_zip.py. Bots will appear as individual zip files in publish folder.

## Getting started
Read the [getting started](./docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) guide.
